They are just beta-testers, churning out test cases and paying corporations to improve software they will soon no longer have access to.\n\nThey think actual artists aren't valuable but they refuse to see that they have even less to offer.  \n\nNetflix is engineering a feedback system where 5%-10%-20% of its content is generated automatically based on viewer metrics. So is YouTube. They all are. No creatives in the pipe. And no \"prompters\" either. \n\nPrompters are even easier to replace with an LLM. And people will watch.",

They are just beta-testers, churning out test cases and paying corporations to improve software they will soon no longer have access to.\n\nThey think actual artists aren't valuable but they refuse to see that they have even less to offer.  \n\nNetflix is engineering a feedback system where 5%-10%-20% of its content is generated automatically based on viewer metrics.

They are just beta-testers, churning out test cases and paying corporations to improve software they will soon no longer have access to.\n\nThey think actual artists aren't valuable but they refuse to see that they have even less to offer.  \n\nNetflix is engineering a feedback system where 5%-10%-20% of its content is generated automatically based on viewer metrics. So is YouTube. They all are. No creatives in the pipe. And no \"prompters\" either. \n\nPrompters are even easier to replace with an LLM. And people will watch.",

No auteurs needed, no crew, no craftspeople, no artists. No-one. \n\nJust a response to viewer metrics fed back into a system to generate more content.  \n\nAll the AIbros delightfully exclaining \"democratization\" and \"anyone can be a film-maker now\" don't seem to realize that they aren't needed either, in the end game. They are just beta-testers, churning out test cases and paying corporations to improve software they will soon no longer have access to.\n\nThey think actual artists aren't valuable but they refuse to see that they have even less to offer.  \n\nNetflix is engineering a feedback system where 5%-10%-20% of its content is generated automatically based on viewer metrics. So is YouTube. They all are. No creatives in the pipe. And no \"prompters\" either. \n\nPrompters are even easier to replace with an LLM. And people will watch.",
